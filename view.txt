-- Step 1: Create the database
CREATE DATABASE university_tech;
USE university_tech;

-- Step 2: Create tables
CREATE TABLE faculties (
    faculty_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    faculty_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE scholars (
    scholar_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    full_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    faculty_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (faculty_id) REFERENCES faculties(faculty_id)
);

-- Step 3: Insert sample data
INSERT INTO faculties (faculty_id, faculty_name) VALUES
(101, 'Information Systems'),
(102, 'Robotics Engineering'),
(103, 'Architecture Engineering');

INSERT INTO scholars (scholar_id, full_name, faculty_id) VALUES
(1, 'Arjun', 101),
(2, 'Priya', 102),
(3, 'Rahul', 101),
(4, 'Neha', 103),
(5, 'Vikram', 102);

-- Step 4: Create view to join scholar and faculty info
CREATE VIEW view_scholar_faculties AS
SELECT
    s.scholar_id,
    s.full_name,
    f.faculty_name
FROM
    scholars s
JOIN
    faculties f ON s.faculty_id = f.faculty_id;

-- Step 5: View with count of scholars per faculty
CREATE VIEW view_faculty_scholar_count AS
SELECT
    f.faculty_name,
    COUNT(s.scholar_id) AS scholar_count
FROM
    faculties f
LEFT JOIN
    scholars s ON f.faculty_id = s.faculty_id
GROUP BY
    f.faculty_name;

-- Step 6: Example update - rename scholar
UPDATE view_scholar_faculties
SET full_name = 'Aditya'
WHERE scholar_id = 1;

-- Step 7: Example update - change scholarâ€™s faculty by updating actual table
UPDATE scholars
SET faculty_id = (
    SELECT faculty_id FROM faculties WHERE faculty_name = 'Architecture Engineering'
)
WHERE scholar_id = 2;

-- Step 8: See final result
SELECT * FROM view_scholar_faculties;
SELECT * FROM view_faculty_scholar_count;

UPDATE scholars
SET full_name = 'Aditya'
WHERE scholar_id = 1;

SELECT * FROM view_scholar_faculties;
